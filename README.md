# Insurance Premium prediction

## Problem statement

	The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
	their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health
	insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our
	study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an
	insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.
